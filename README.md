This is a small proof of concept for AR previews of bikes on the web.  
  
It uses [Google's model-viewer library](https://modelviewer.dev/) to show a 3D model of a bike and allow users to display that model in AR.  
It integrates with both [Apple's ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/) and [Android's ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar) to offer all native features of the respective platforms through the web, and is based on the [open WebXR standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/).
